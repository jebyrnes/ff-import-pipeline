To use, make a directory called `new_for_upload` and in it a directory named `accepted` and `rejected`  
  
Alter `tile_image_filter` with directory where ff import has taken place, the right parameters for satellite types, and cores. Then let her rip.  
  
Note, peruse `image_filtering_method.R` if you want to consider alternate image filtering functions.
